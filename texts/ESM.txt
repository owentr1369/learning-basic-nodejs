What is ESM?
- ESM stands for ES Modules. It is Javascript's proposal to implement a 
standard module system. I am sure many of you have seen this:

- ESM is the best module format thanks to its simple syntax, async nature, and tree-shakeability.
- UMD works everywhere and usually used as a fallback in case ESM does not work
- CJS is synchronous and good for back end.
- AMD is asynchronous and good for front end.
