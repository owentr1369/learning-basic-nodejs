What is Node.js?
- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 
It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 
JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows 
Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without 
creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous 
I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from 
blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking
paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

Is Node.js programming language?
It is necessary to understand that Node.js is NOT a framework or a library, 
as with traditional application software, but rather a runtime environment.

Why use Node.js?
1. Language Sharing Across the Stack
2. Rapid Development
3. The Node Package Manager
4. Single-Threaded Event Loop Architecture 
5. Native Support in AWS

History of Node.js
Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about thirteen years after 
the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's 
LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its 
development and maintenance were led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.

Node.js vs Browser
Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language.
Building apps that run in the browser is entirely different than building a
Node.js application. Even though it's always JavaScript, some key differences 
make the experience radically different.
